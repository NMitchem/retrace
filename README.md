# retrace

A record/replay reverse debugger for Apple Silicon. See
`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-05-retrace-macos-record-replay-design.md`.

## Status: M0 — Box & Trace Spine ✅

Records a freestanding ARM64 guest inside a single-vCPU Hypervisor.framework VM and
replays it bit-for-bit from a snapshot, proving zero divergence over 200 fault-injection
seeds. Requires macOS 26.x on Apple Silicon.

M0's guest is a **freestanding synthetic binary** (`crates/retrace-guest/asm/hello.s`,
raw `write`/`exit` syscalls with the MMU off) — not the spec's `/bin/echo`-class
dynamically-linked program. Real dynamically-linked binaries need the dyld-shared-cache
loader, deferred to M2 (see below).

The divergence checker compares, per traced syscall, the `(num, args)` tuple and the
final exit code; M0's bit-for-bit guarantee rests on determinism-by-construction (the same
recorded inputs replayed through the same deterministic handler) plus CRC-checked trace
integrity, not on an exhaustive state comparison. (M1, below, adds a full-memory comparison
at exit as the divergence oracle's final check.)

```
just m0                                   # run the full gate
cargo run -p retrace -- record <macho> -o t.bin
cargo run -p retrace -- replay t.bin
```

Every binary is ad-hoc codesigned with `com.apple.security.hypervisor` automatically
(`.cargo/config.toml` runner). Non-root; SIP may stay enabled.

### Running tests

The in-process VM tests require `--test-threads=1`: Hypervisor.framework allows only one
VM per process on macOS, so tests that create a VM in-process must run one at a time.
`just m0` already sets this (`cargo test --workspace -- --test-threads=1`). A bare
`cargo test` may flake with `HV_BUSY` if the default multi-threaded test runner overlaps
two in-process VMs.

## Status: M1 — General Memory-Diff Syscall Recorder ✅

M1 replaces M0's hand-written `write`/`exit` handlers with a **general recorder**: on any
syscall trap it pointer-chases the argument registers, snapshots a window around each guest
pointer, forwards the real syscall to the host kernel (translating guest pointers to host
backing addresses), and diffs to find what the kernel wrote — logged as `writes: Vec<Region>`.
Replay applies the recorded writes and feeds the recorded return value; it never executes a
syscall itself. No per-syscall models — the same machinery handles `open`/`fstat`/`read`/
`close` without the recorder knowing anything about their semantics.

Proven on two guests (still freestanding, MMU-off, `crates/retrace-guest/asm/`):

- **`fileio`** — opens a fixture file, `fstat`s it, `read`s it, writes the bytes to stdout,
  closes it. Replays **byte-for-byte identically after the input fixture file is deleted** —
  the recorded `writes` (the kernel-filled read buffer) fully reconstruct the guest's memory
  without touching the filesystem again.
- **`mmapguest`** — `mmap`s an anonymous region, stores a byte pattern into it with ordinary
  loads/stores (no syscall), reads it back, and `munmap`s it. `mmap` is special-cased (it
  creates a new tracked backing at a deterministic fresh guest address); the plain stores
  replay by re-execution, not by diff.

The divergence oracle now includes a **final full-memory comparison** at guest exit (`Box_::
diff_memory`), on top of M0's per-syscall `(num, args)` check — so a divergence introduced
anywhere in guest memory, not just at a traced syscall boundary, is caught and named.

The trampoline, trace format (now with a 4-byte magic/version header and `Event::Syscall.
writes`), snapshot, divergence checker, and seeded swarm from M0 carry forward — the swarm
now records/replays both the file-I/O and mmap guests, 200 fault-injection seeds each,
proving the same zero-silent-divergence property as M0 over the new general recorder.

**Deferred to M2 or later:**
- **Error-ABI fidelity.** M1 assumes every recorded syscall succeeds; the macOS raw-syscall
  error convention (carry flag set, `x0` = errno) is not modeled. Guests/fixtures are
  constructed so nothing fails.
- **Honoring `munmap`/`mprotect`.** Both are recorded as no-ops in M1 (ret 0, no writes):
  with the MMU off, a trusted guest, and no address reuse, they write no guest memory, so
  skipping them is safe for now. A real loader with address-space reuse will need to honor
  them.
- **32-bit / narrow return-value fidelity** for syscalls that don't return a full 64-bit
  value.

**M2** is the loader: MMU-on guest page tables, a standalone `dyld` startup with pointer
authentication (PAC), and the dyld-shared-cache loader — so a real dynamically-linked binary
(a normally-compiled C program linking `libSystem`) loads and runs. The memory-diff engine,
trace format, divergence oracle, and seeded swarm from M1 carry forward unchanged.

```
just m1                                   # run the full gate (same recipe as `just m0`)
```
